## Our Repo
[Group05 Repo](https://github.com/Brown-Doge/Spotify-Content-App--Group5-p01)


## Project Description
The user is able to sign up/login. Once logged in, he is able to search a movie, look at trending movies right now, favorite a movie and look at his profile/logout tab. Once clicking on a specific movie, the user is able to see a little overview, ratings, runtime and the year it was released inside a Modal.

## Our Process
- We first decided on a Spotify App but later on created a Movie app using TMDB's API. 
- The first week was preparing and brainstorming what we wanted to do with this app. 
- We created the foundation of our project the second week. Which includes things like login, signup, implementing the API, and setting up the database. 
- The third week was refining these things, creating the favorites/trending tabs and also making sure everything was connected to each other, which includes the unit testing (db testing, favoriting movie testing, login testing). 
- Fourth week was to polish our project and tweak anything that needed to be addressed.

-The biggest challenge was making sure everything was connected properly. Connecting our API to our app and connecting the favorites tab to each user ID was a bit challenging because I wanted to make sure it properly worked with everything else as well.
-The most interesting part of the project in my opinion was playing around with the API once I got it connected. I didn't realize how many calls we could make within this API and how much information we can display too. 
-The most valuable thing I learned was how much you should be organized and stay on top of things to efficiently complete this project, I believe we did a good job at that as well.

## Communication
Majority of our communication was through Slack, if a major problem occurred we would discuss it in class and resolve it. Andrew focused on making sure communication was smooth. This included things like connecting our GitHub PR requests through Slack and also creating a voting system on issue stories to see how difficult/important the issue was. We each completed 4 issues each. The goal was to make around 16 stories at first, while doing the project, more issues would arise, which would then be solved by one of us.

## Running the project
For this project we needed an API key which means to create a TMDB account and copy the API key from the account. We also created a .env file at the root of the project and named the key EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY = "". To get the key you could create a TMDB account and apply your own key, if you do not want to do that, we can message the Professor or TA our key. Once you have the key all you need to do is run:

- ## npm install
- ## npx expo start

## Conclusion
Overall. our project was successful in terms of what we had in mind and what we got done. Obviously, if we had more time we would be able to create a much larger version of this app and fully dive deep into the API that we used.
