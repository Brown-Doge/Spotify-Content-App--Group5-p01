# Project 01 Retrospective and Overview  

[Github Repo](https://github.com/Brown-Doge/Spotify-Content-App--Group5-p01)  

## Overview  
This is a movie application built using TMDB’s API. The app allows users to sign up/login, search for movies, view trending movies, favorite movies, and manage their profile. Clicking a specific movie opens a modal that shows an overview, ratings, runtime, and release year.  

## Introduction  

* Communication was primarily managed through Slack, with in-class discussions for major problems.  
* The team initially considered around 16 stories/issues.  
* Each member completed 4 issues, with additional issues handled as they arose during development.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on  
Andrew worked on user backend functionality such as user routes and GitHub login. He also handled most of the UI, including tabs and user/public views.

  + Getting GitHub login to work like the regular login.  
+ Why was it a challenge?  
  + He didn’t know how to properly connect the login information to the database or route the login to the user view, which caused duplicate login pages.  
+ How was the challenge addressed?  
  + By trial and error, refining the routing and database connections until the login process worked correctly.  
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project  
  + Making the front end work, since it showcased the results of all the backend efforts.  
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?  
  + He would skip the GitHub OAuth login and instead go more in depth on another feature.  
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?  
  + Communication and setting clear expectations within the team are crucial.
